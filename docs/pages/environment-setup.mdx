# Environment Setup

Follow these instructions to set up your environment to use the v2 Wallet API. Make sure to set up your environment variables before running any code snippets.

## API Keys and Secrets

To use the Coinbase Wallet API v2, you need to set up the following credentials:

1. **Create a CDP Secret API key**

   - Log in to your [Coinbase Developer Portal](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/overview)
   - Navigate to the API Keys section
   - Create a new key with default permissions

2. **Generate a Wallet Secret**

   - Visit the [Wallet API product page](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/wallet-api)
   - Click on the "Generate" button in the Wallet Secret section
   - This secret is used to encrypt and decrypt your wallet data
   - Store this securely as it cannot be recovered if lost

3. **Export these variables in your shell**

```bash
export CDP_API_KEY_ID=your-api-key-id
export CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=your-api-key-secret
export CDP_WALLET_SECRET=your-wallet-secret
```

## Security Recommendations

When working with API keys and secrets, follow these security best practices:

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Consider using a .env file with a package like dotenv
- Enable IP whitelisting for production environments
- Rotate API keys periodically

## Next Steps

Once your environment is set up, you can return to the [Quickstart Guide](/getting-started) to begin building with the Wallet API v2.
