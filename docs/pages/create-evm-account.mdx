# Create an EVM Account

The following code illustrates how to create an EVM account managed by the v2 Wallet API.

**main.ts**

```javascript
import { CdpClient } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk";

const cdp = new CdpClient();

const evmAccount = await cdp.evm.createAccount();
console.log(`Created account: ${evmAccount.address}`);
```

> **Caution**
> In a production environment, we recommend turning on IP Whitelisting.
