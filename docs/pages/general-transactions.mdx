# General Transactions

Smart accounts support the EIP-4337 standard, which allows for advanced features like gas sponsorship and batched transactions. Here's an example of sending a user operation from a smart account:

**main.ts**

```javascript
import { CdpClient } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk";
import { parseEther } from "viem";

const cdp = new CdpClient();

const evmAccount = await cdp.evm.createAccount();
const smartAccount = await cdp.evm.createSmartAccount({
  owner: evmAccount,
});
console.log(`Created smart account: ${smartAccount.address}`);

const sendResult = await cdp.evm.sendUserOperation({
  smartAccount,
  network: "base-sepolia",
  calls: [
    {
      to: evmAccount.address,
      value: parseEther("0"),
      data: "0x",
    },
  ],
});

console.log("User operation sent with operation hash:", sendResult.userOpHash);
console.log("Waiting for user operation to be confirmed...");

const waitResult = await cdp.evm.waitForUserOperation({
  smartAccountAddress: smartAccount.address,
  userOpHash: sendResult.userOpHash,
});

console.log("User operation confirmed with status:", waitResult.status);

const userOp = await cdp.evm.getUserOperation({
  smartAccount,
  userOpHash: sendResult.userOpHash,
});

console.log("Transaction hash:", userOp.transactionHash);
```

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Create a regular EVM account
2. Create a smart account with the EVM account as its owner
3. Send a user operation from the smart account
4. Wait for the operation to be confirmed
5. Retrieve the transaction details
