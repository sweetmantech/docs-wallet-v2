# Create an EVM Smart Account

Smart accounts are smart contracts on EVM blockchains that offer advanced functionality such as gas sponsorships and spend permissions.

Smart accounts require an owner account to sign on its behalf. In this example, we will use the previously created EVM account as the owner.

**main.ts**

```javascript
import { CdpClient } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk";

const cdp = new CdpClient();

const evmAccount = await cdp.evm.createAccount();
const smartAccount = await cdp.evm.createSmartAccount({
  owner: evmAccount,
});
console.log(`Created smart account: ${smartAccount.address}`);
```
