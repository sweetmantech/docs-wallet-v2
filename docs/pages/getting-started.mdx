# Quickstart

> This documentation is based on the [official Coinbase Wallet API v2 Quickstart](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-api-v2/docs/quickstart).

The v2 Wallet API allows you to create onchain accounts and send funds within minutes. In this quickstart, you will learn how to create an EVM account, fund it with testnet ETH, and transfer funds between accounts.

## What you'll learn

- How to install the v2 CDP SDK
- How to create an EVM account
- How to fund your account with testnet ETH
- How to create an EVM smart account
- How to use EIP-4337 User Operations

## Requirements

> **Info**
> Make sure that your developer environment satisfies all of the requirements before proceeding through the quickstart.

The CDP SDK requires Node.js v18.x or higher. You can run the following command in your terminal to check your local Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

## Setup

Follow these steps to run the code snippets in this quickstart:

1. Initialize a new project by running

```bash
mkdir cdp-sdk-example && cd cdp-sdk-example && npm init -y
```

2. Add "type": "module" to your package.json file that was created in the previous step

```json
{
  "name": "cdp-sdk-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

3. Install the CDP SDK

```bash
npm install @coinbase/cdp-sdk
```

4. Create a new file called main.ts

```bash
touch main.ts
```

5. Copy and paste the example code you'd like to run into main.ts

- [Create an EVM Account](/create-evm-account)
- [Fund an EVM Account](/fund-evm-account)
- [Create an EVM Smart Account](/create-smart-account)
- [General Transactions](/general-transactions)

6. Execute main.ts

```bash
npx tsx main.ts
```

> **Important**
> Before running any code examples, make sure to set up your environment variables as described in the [Environment Setup](/environment-setup) guide.
