# Fund an EVM Account

Accounts do not have funds on them to start. We provide a Faucet API to fund your account with testnet ETH.

**main.ts**

```javascript
import { CdpClient } from "@coinbase/cdp-sdk";

const cdp = new CdpClient();

const evmAccount = await cdp.evm.createAccount();
const { transactionHash } = await cdp.evm.requestFaucet({
  address: evmAccount.address,
  network: "base-sepolia",
  token: "eth",
});

console.log(
  `Requested funds from faucet: https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/${transactionHash}`
);
```

## Next Steps

After funding your EVM account, you can:

- [Send transactions](/general-transactions)
